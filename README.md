# Cyber Security Ciphers in React

This project provides implementations of various classical ciphers using React and TypeScript. The ciphers are implemented as individual components and can be used to understand and visualize how these encryption techniques work.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server and you can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:




## Cipher Implementations

The following ciphers are implemented in the `pages` directory:

- **Affine Cipher (`affine.tsx`)**: Implements the Affine cipher encryption and decryption.
- **Columnar Transposition Cipher (`columnar.tsx`)**: Implements the Columnar Transposition cipher.
- **Feistel Cipher (`feistel.tsx`)**: Implements a basic Feistel cipher structure.
- **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher (`mono.tsx` and `monoalphabetic.tsx`)**: Implements the Monoalphabetic Substitution cipher.
- **Playfair Cipher (`playfair.tsx`)**: Implements the Playfair cipher.
- **Rail Fence Cipher (`railfence.tsx`)**: Implements the Rail Fence cipher.
- **Shift Cipher (`shift.tsx`)**: Implements the Shift cipher (Caesar cipher).
- **Vigenère Cipher (`vigener.tsx`)**: Implements the Vigenère cipher.
